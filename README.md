# bincastle

Bincastle is a library for building Linux systems from source-code into statically-linked binaries that bootstrap themselves into rootless containers.

Don't use it yet. It's currently somewhere between the stages of "barely-functioning-prototype" and "pre-alpha-use-it-if-you-are-brave". I'll update this README with more details once it's ready for wider consumption.
